# SVG Extend
{: .fs-9 }

**SVG Extend** is an experiment to find ways to make SVG smarter and more
usable/lovable by web authors. It also acts as a playground to discuss implementation
use cases with browser vendors.

If you are an SVG user and want to help improving SVG, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/JeremiePat/svg-extend/issues) to discuss
how *SVG Extend* can help you make your life easier. If you want to get
involved into deeper discussion about the future of SVG, feel free to join the
W3C [SVG Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/svgcg/).

As of now, *SVG Extend* extends some elements to ease creating some
basic shapes:

  * [Regular polygons and stars]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link element.star.md %})
  * [Euclidean polygons]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link element.ngon.md %})

Here is a unordered, open, list of what we plan for the future:

  * Extend elements to draw *spirals*
  * Extend elements to auto-smooth curves
  * Extend path syntax to support polar coordinates
